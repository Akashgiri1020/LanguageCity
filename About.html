                </h2>
                <p class="lead">How to Choose Best Laptop for Programming?
                    RAM
                    It is the first most important thing that you should look. A laptop with 8GB RAM is an ideal choice but 16GB RAM would the best choice. If your budget is too low then you can go with 4GB RAM also.
                    
                    Believe me it really sucks working on a low performance machine. Earlier I used to do android app development on a laptop with 4GB RAM. It was so annoying because everything works really slow.
                    
                    So I would highly recommend you a 16GB RAM laptop if you are a mobile app developer.
                    
                    Best Choice: 16GB RAM
                    
                    Ideal Choice: 8GB RAM
                    
                    Low Budget Choice: 4GB RAM
                    
                    Processor
                    Good processor and RAM should be your highest priority while choosing a laptop for programming. As a programmer or developer we have to do multitasking. When I do programming or development I have to open few IDEs along with a browser with several tabs opened. For such purpose a good processor is required.
                    
                    A laptop with i5 processor is an ideal choice. You can go with i7 processor if you have huge budget and for low budget you can go with i3 processor.
                    
                    Best Choice: i7 Processor
                    
                    Ideal Choice: i5 Processor
                    
                    Low Budget Choice: i3 Processor
                    
                    Graphic Card
                    External graphic card is not necessary until you are not doing game development or some high graphics related work. But if you are a game developer then you must go with a laptop with external graphic card.
                    
                    Best Choice (Specially For Game Developers): External Graphic Card (2GB or 4GB)
                    
                    Ideal and Low Budget Choice (For Other Developers): Integrated Graphic Card
                    
                    Storage
                    SSD and HDD are two storage types that laptops have. SSD gives faster performance but costlier than HDD. Its great if you can afford a SSD storage type laptop. But if you can’t then go with HDD and later on you can use some external SSD storage.
                    
                    Battery Life
                    If you mostly work at places where power supply is not available then you must choose a laptop with huge battery life. Otherwise these days almost all laptops come with moderate battery backup.
                    
                    You can get custom programmer laptop stickers at www.stickeryou.com.
                    
                    Below I have shared some laptops that I believe are good for programmers in India. Even if you don’t like any of them you can consider above points to pick a best laptop according to your usage.</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">Let’s not kid ourselves: everything we think we know now is just an approximation to something we haven’t yet found out.
                    That is the frustrating, exhilarating lesson history teaches us about fundamental theories of nature.
                     Take Newton’s universal law of gravity. It did sterling service describing falling apples and orbiting planets for over two centuries, but eventually gave way to a “righter” theory – Einstein’s general relativity. 
                     Ditto the solidly intuitive outlines of classical mechanics:
                     dig down to the level of subatomic particles, and we find them fogged in a haze of quantum uncertainty.</p>
